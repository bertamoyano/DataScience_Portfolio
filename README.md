      <p>This study examines academic success and dropout rates among university students by using advanced statistical methods and unsupervised learning methods to identify subpopulations and specific profiles within the data. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand initial patterns, followed by clustering techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were employed to explore and characterize these patterns.</p>

      <p>This study investigates the link between social capital and individual happiness in Europe using multilevel analysis on data from 42,151 individuals across 23 countries (2012-2018). The findings reveal that social trust, institutional trust, and informal social interactions significantly impact happiness, while national-level social capital indicators have little effect in the short term. This study is conducted in R using data analytics tools and statistical methods. </p>
