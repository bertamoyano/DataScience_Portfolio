# Data Science Portfolio - Berta Moyano
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. This portfolio also contains my skill, and certificates. It is updated on the regular basis.

      Telco Customer Churn Prediction
    </a>
  </strong>
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  This project focuses on predicting Telco customer churn using various metrics and models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, AdaBoost, and Logistic Regression. Given the challenge of class imbalance we used probability weighting to improve accuracy. The Random Forest model, after hyperparameter tuning, performed best in terms of Profit @ Top-20 and AUC, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying high-value churners.

      Social Media Influence of Belgian Politicians
    </a>
  </strong>
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  Using Memgraph for Cypher queries and Gephi for visualization, we analyzed X (formerly Twitter) data from 150 Belgian parliament members to understand their social media influence and engagement, specially during the election campaign. We found that tweets with community notes, often linked to controversial content, received fewer likes, replies, and retweets but more views. Politicians and parties with extreme positions, especially on the right, had higher incidences of community notes, highlighting the need for vigilance in the era of misinformation.

      Social Capital and Individual Happiness: A Multilevel Approach
    </a>
  </strong>
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  This study investigates the link between social capital and individual happiness in Europe using multilevel analysis on data from 42,151 individuals across 23 countries (2012-2018). The findings reveal that social trust, institutional trust, and informal social interactions significantly impact happiness, while national-level social capital indicators have little effect in the short term. This study is conducted in R using data analytics tools and statistical methods.

      Analysis of Academic Success and Dropout in University Students (Catalan)
    </a>
  </strong>
</p>
<p dir="auto">
  This study examines academic success and dropout rates among university students by using advanced statistical methods and unsupervised learning methods to identify subpopulations and specific profiles within the data. Using R, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand initial patterns, followed by clustering techniques, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were employed to explore and characterize these patterns.
