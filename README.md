  This project utilizes deep learning to predict game prices based on images from the Steam Store. With over 14,000 games and 125,000 images, we preprocess both tabular and image data, apply data augmentation, and build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for price prediction. Our modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using MAE and MSE.

  This project focuses on predicting Telco customer churn using various metrics and models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, AdaBoost, and Logistic Regression. Given the challenge of class imbalance we used probability weighting to improve accuracy.

  We used Spark Streaming to build a predictive model for Hacker News articles, processing text with tf-idf and word2vec and including features like votes and comments. Logistic regression was selected for its strong performance and interpretability, effectively predicting front-page news.

<p dir="auto">
  This study examines academic success and dropout rates among university students by using advanced statistical methods and unsupervised learning methods to identify subpopulations and specific profiles within the data. Using R, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand initial patterns, followed by clustering techniques, PCA, MCA and LDA were employed to explore and characterize these patterns.

<p dir="auto">
  Using Memgraph for Cypher queries and Gephi for visualization, we analyzed X (formerly Twitter) data from 150 Belgian parliament members to understand their social media influence and engagement, specially during the election campaign. We found that tweets with community notes, often linked to controversial content, received fewer likes, replies, and retweets but more views were often from politicians and parties with extreme positions.

  This study investigates the link between social capital and individual happiness in Europe using multilevel analysis on data from individuals across 23 countries during 2012-2018. The findings reveal that institutional trust and informal social interactions significantly impact happiness, while national-level social capital indicators have little effect in the short term.
